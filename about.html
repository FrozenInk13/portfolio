            <p>Hello! My name is Jane Doe, a student studying mathematics and other related subjects at the UO. While mathematics is my major, I also hold an interest in both writing and coding. Whenever I'm not doing schoolwork or studying, I'm most likely doing either of those activities, spending time with my family, reading, or doing some other activity to relax.</p>
            <p>After I graduate, I'm planning on getting a job about or having to do with data analytics. Being able to manipulate and understand data is something that's naturally interesting to me, and with the classes I'm both currently taking and are planning to take in the future I should be ready to partake in whatever the industry requires of me.</p>
            <p>Astronomy has always held a special place in my heart from the moment when I first started learning about the space outside our own planet. It's one of my special interests, and I wanted to share even just a little bit of what I knew about it with this website. If you're able to find even a little bit of enjoyment with what I've put out here, then I'd count that as a win for me.</p>
