                <p>A spiral galaxy is a type of galaxy that is shaped like a spiral, as-per its name. The galaxy shown above <!-- to the left?? idk where yet --> is known as Messier 96, and is a more asymmetric sprial galaxy than most.</p>

                <h3>Barred Spiral</h3>
                <p>A barred spiral galaxy is very similar to a spiral galaxy with the only difference being its center is shaped like a bar. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is an example of one of these galaxies.</p>

                <h3>Star Clusters</h3>
                <p>A star cluster is simply just a group of stars clustered together, most commonly due to them all being born from the same nebula. There are two main types of star clusters based on how they're arranged; globular and open.</p>

        <div class="crafts-desc">
            <p class="first-para">Our knowledge of what lies beyond what we can see would be nowhere near as extensive as it is now without tools we've used to find new, interesting objects in space. Ground-based telescopes are helpful on a ground level, but they aren't powerful enough to detect everything we know is out there. That's where space telescopes come in, which are devices created on Earth and sent up into space to gather images we would have no chance of seeing on Earth and send them back to us to analyze and make sense of. The two most well-known space telescopes are the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, both of which have greatly increased our knowledge of the cosmos. The James Webb Space Telescope is the most recent of these crafts sent out, and the images it's recorded have already done wonders to our understanding of how the universe and other galaxies work.</p>
            <p>Below is an image of the galactic cluster SMACS 0723 captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. Compared to the space telescopes we've used before, the images from this space telescope are clear enough to make out stellar objects we couldn't have even dreamed of being able to see before.</p>
